"""
The program is trying to translate a sentence captured as user input.
We first read in the text file textese.txt.
Then from the file, we create a list of strings from each lines in the text file.
Then, we create a dictionary the list.
Once the text file has been read into memory, we close the file.

We then define a function for translating which envolves splitting the user input (sentence) into an
array of strings ("enjoy the excellent band tonight") ["enjoy", "the", "excellent", "band", "tonight"]

After each word is translated, we then
print out the translated sentence to the user.
